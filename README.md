# Blogg

This is the beginning of a minimalistic blog/social media application built using no Javascript, only Python and HMTL. It allows users to create, read, and delete blog posts as well as add, and delete comments to those posts. I want to style it differently, but it's functioning well at the moment. 

Features
User authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely.
Responsive design: The application is designed to be accessible and usable across various devices and screen sizes.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/jgtwenty3/Blog.git

Navigate into the project directory:
cd Blog

pip install

pipenv shell (for virtual environment)

Set up the database:

flask db migrate
flask db upgrade

Run the application:

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to access the application.
